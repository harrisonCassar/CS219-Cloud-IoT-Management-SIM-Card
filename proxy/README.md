# Proxy
This directory contains a basic Proxy Python application for forwarding UDP traffic from one source IP address/port to a destination IP address/port.

## Usage
The usage of the Python proxy application can be seen as follows:

```bash
# Invoke the script with the `--help` option:
./proxy.py --help

# ...or, alternatively, with the Python3 interpreter:
python3 ./proxy.py --help
```
