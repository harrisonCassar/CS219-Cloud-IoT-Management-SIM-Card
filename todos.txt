Required TODOs:
- Nicer front-end.
- Actual Modem Client.
- Setup Docker-deployable setup for "local" (Modem/SIM Client) and "cloud" (everything else) subsystems. Currently, we're just deploying to one machine... perhaps this okay if we separate the networks...?

Desirable TODOs:
- Live/auto-refresh on status (not sure where we need to push the status/state, but if its to a Flask endpoint, that's ideal, since we already have that set-up).
- Add multiple sensors of a certain type (i.e. multiple IMU sensors) (likely let's add a device ID into the Kafka message?)
- Add "About Us" and "Background" pages for the project. Just can be basic text.
